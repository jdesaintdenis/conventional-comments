# Thought

![thought](../thought/thought.svg)

Thoughts represent an idea that popped up from reviewing. These comments are non-blocking by nature, but they are extremely valuable and can lead to more focused initiatives and mentoring opportunities.

## Possible decorations

### Non-blocking
![thought(non-blocking)](../thought/thought-non_blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should not prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default.

### Blocking

![thought(blocking)](../thought/thought-blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default.

### If minor

![thought(if-minor)](../thought/thought-if_minor.svg)

This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes end up being minor or trivial.
