# Question

![question](../question/question.svg)

Questions are appropriate if you have a potential concern but are not quite sure if it’s relevant or not. Asking the author for clarification or investigation can lead to a quick resolution.

## Possible decorations

### Non-blocking
![question(non-blocking)](../question/question-non_blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should not prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default.

### Blocking

![question(blocking)](../question/question-blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default.

### If minor

![question(if-minor)](../question/question-if_minor.svg)

This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes end up being minor or trivial.
