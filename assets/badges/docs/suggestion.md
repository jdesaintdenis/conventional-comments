# Suggestion

![suggestion](../suggestion/suggestion.svg)

Suggestions propose improvements to the current subject. It’s important to be explicit and clear on what is being suggested and why it is an improvement. Consider using patches and the blocking or non-blocking decorations to further communicate your intent.

## Possible decorations

### Non-blocking
![suggestion(non-blocking)](../suggestion/suggestion-non_blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should not prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default.

### Blocking

![suggestion(blocking)](../suggestion/suggestion-blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default.

### If minor

![suggestion(if-minor)](../suggestion/suggestion-if_minor.svg)

This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes end up being minor or trivial.
