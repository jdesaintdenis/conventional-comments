# Chore

![chore](../chore/chore.svg)

Chores are simple tasks that must be done before the subject can be “officially” accepted. Usually, these comments reference some common process. Try to leave a link to the process description so that the reader knows how to resolve the chore.

## Possible decorations

### Non-blocking
![chore(non-blocking)](../chore/chore-non_blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should not prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default.

### Blocking

![chore(blocking)](../chore/chore-blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default.

### If minor

![chore(if-minor)](../chore/chore-if_minor.svg)

This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes end up being minor or trivial.
