# Todo

![todo](../todo/todo.svg)

TODO’s are small, trivial, but necessary changes. Distinguishing todo comments from [issues](./issue.md): or [suggestions](./suggestion.md): helps direct the reader’s attention to comments requiring more involvement.

## Possible decorations

### Non-blocking
![todo(non-blocking)](../todo/todo-non_blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should not prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default.

### Blocking

![todo(blocking)](../todo/todo-blocking.svg)

A comment with this decoration should prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default.

### If minor

![todo(if-minor)](../todo/todo-if_minor.svg)

This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes end up being minor or trivial.
